## 📞 Cold Call Script — Pawan Verma (CDIO)

**Objective:** Secure a 20-minute discovery call

---

**[If Pawan Answers]**

> "Hi Pawan, this is {{SenderName}} from {{Company}}. Do you have two minutes?"

**[If Yes]**

> "Great, I'll be brief. I'm reaching out because I saw the announcement about your role as Chief Data and Information Officer—congratulations. Given Cencora's $1B infrastructure investment and your focus on digital transformation, I wanted to share how other Fortune 100 healthcare distributors are using Red Hat Ansible to automate network operations at scale.
>
> One company similar to Cencora was able to push consistent configurations across 40 countries in minutes instead of days, and they cut compliance audit prep time by 90%.
>
> I'm not sure if this is on your radar yet, but I thought it might be worth a 20-minute conversation to see if there's a fit. Would that make sense?"

**[If "Not interested" or "We're good"]**

> "Totally fair—I appreciate you letting me know. If you don't mind me asking, is the network team handling automation in-house, or is this just not a priority right now? Either way, I'd love to send over a one-pager in case it becomes relevant down the road. What's the best email?"

**[If "Send me something"]**

> "Absolutely. I'll send a brief overview with a case study from a pharma distributor that's similar to Cencora. What email should I use? And if there's a specific pain point you'd like me to address—compliance, global consistency, anything else—let me know and I'll tailor it."

**[If Asks Who Is This / What's Ansible]**

> "Great question. Ansible is Red Hat's automation platform—it lets your network team automate configurations, compliance checks, and changes across any network vendor without installing agents on devices. It's particularly popular in healthcare and pharma because of the compliance and audit requirements. Would it help if I sent a quick overview?"

## 📞 Cold Call Script — Ajay Gupta (CISO)

**Objective:** Position automation as a security initiative

---

**[If Ajay Answers]**

> "Hi Ajay, this is {{SenderName}} from {{Company}}. First, congratulations on the Top Global CISO recognition—well deserved. Do you have a quick minute?"

**[If Yes]**

> "I'll keep it brief. I work with CISOs at global healthcare companies on a challenge I imagine is familiar: ensuring network configurations are consistent, auditable, and secure across a large, distributed infrastructure.
>
> With Ansible Automation Platform, security teams are automating firewall rules, compliance validation, and configuration drift detection—all with complete audit trails.
>
> Given Cencora's 50-country footprint and the criticality of your supply chain security, I thought this might be relevant to your 2025 priorities. Would a 15-minute conversation make sense to explore if there's a fit?"

**[If "Not interested"]**

> "Understood. Is the security team already working on network automation, or is this more of a network ops responsibility at Cencora? Either way, I'd love to send a one-pager on how automation reduces attack surface—might be useful for your team. What's the best email?"

## 📞 Cold Call Script — VP/Director of Network Engineering

**Objective:** Connect with the hands-on network leadership

---

**[Opening]**

> "Hi {{FirstName}}, this is {{SenderName}} from {{Company}}. I know I'm calling out of the blue—do you have two minutes?"

**[If Yes]**

> "Thanks. I'll be quick. I work with network teams at global pharmaceutical and healthcare companies—organizations with hundreds or thousands of network devices across multiple sites and vendors.
>
> The challenge I hear most often is: 'We're drowning in manual configuration work, and we can't keep up with the growth.'
>
> We've helped companies similar to Cencora automate network operations using Ansible—pushing configs to 1,000+ devices in under an hour, eliminating configuration drift, and generating compliance reports automatically.
>
> I'm curious—is scaling network operations something you're focused on, or is the team pretty comfortable with the current approach?"

**[Listen and Respond]**

**If they mention challenges:**
> "That's exactly what I hear. Would it make sense to schedule a 20-minute call to walk through how other companies have tackled this? I can share some real examples."

**If they say they're using something else:**
> "That's great—what are you using today? (Listen) Ansible actually integrates well with a lot of those tools. Would it be worth a quick conversation to compare approaches?"

**If they're not interested:**
> "Totally fair. If things change or this becomes a priority, I'd love to reconnect. Can I send you a one-pager to keep on file?"

## 📞 Voicemail Scripts

### Voicemail 1 — Initial
> "Hi {{FirstName}}, this is {{SenderName}} from {{Company}}. I'm reaching out because I work with network leaders at global healthcare organizations on automation—specifically, helping them push consistent configurations across hundreds of devices in minutes instead of days.
>
> Given Cencora's scale and your infrastructure expansion, I thought this might be relevant.
>
> My number is {{Phone}}. I'll also send you a brief email. Looking forward to connecting."

---

### Voicemail 2 — Follow-Up (Day 3)
> "Hi {{FirstName}}, this is {{SenderName}} following up. I sent an email about network automation for pharmaceutical distribution—specifically, how companies like Cencora are automating compliance, reducing configuration drift, and scaling operations globally.
>
> If this is on your radar, I'd love 15 minutes to share how it works. My number is {{Phone}}. Talk soon."

---

### Voicemail 3 — Final (Day 7)
> "Hi {{FirstName}}, {{SenderName}} again. I'll keep this brief—this is my last voicemail. If network automation becomes a priority for Cencora, I'd love to help.

## 🗣️ Objection Handling

### "We already have automation in place."
> "That's great—what are you using today? (Listen) Many of the companies we work with started with scripts or other tools and found that Ansible gives them better multi-vendor support and audit capabilities. Would it be worth comparing approaches?"

---

### "This is a network ops decision, not mine."
> "Understood—who on the network team should I be speaking with? If you could point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it."

---

### "We're too busy right now."
> "Totally understand. When would be a better time to revisit this? I can follow up in Q2 if that works. In the meantime, can I send a one-pager for your reference?"

---

### "We're happy with Cisco/Arista native tools."
> "That makes sense. Ansible actually complements those tools—it can orchestrate across Cisco, Arista, Palo Alto, and others from a single platform. Would it be worth a quick call to see how they work together?"

---

### "What's the cost?"
> "Great question. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is subscription-based, and pricing depends on the number of nodes managed. I can get you a ballpark after a quick discovery call—usually, the ROI is clear within the first 90 days. Would a brief call make sense?"

---

### "Send me information."
> "Absolutely. I'll send a one-pager and a case study from a similar pharma distributor. After you've had a chance to review, would you be open to a 15-minute call to answer any questions? What's the best email?"
