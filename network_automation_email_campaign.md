Hi {{FirstName}},

I noticed {{CompanyName}} is scaling rapidly, and I wanted to reach out because I've seen firsthand how manual network configuration becomes a bottleneck at this stage.

**Here's the reality most network teams face:**
- Configuration drift across devices
- Hours spent on repetitive tasks
- Human errors causing outages
- Compliance audits becoming nightmares

**What if you could:**
✅ Push consistent configurations to hundreds of devices in minutes  
✅ Eliminate human error with repeatable, tested automation  
✅ Create self-documenting infrastructure changes  
✅ Enable your team to focus on innovation, not maintenance

The **Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform** gives network teams a simple, agentless way to automate everything from switch configurations to firewall rules—using the same YAML-based playbooks that IT operations teams already love.

I'd love to share how organizations like yours have cut network provisioning time by **90%** and reduced configuration-related incidents by **75%**.

**Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation** to explore if this could help {{CompanyName}}?

Hi {{FirstName}},

I wanted to follow up on my previous note and share something I thought might be useful for your team.

One of the biggest mistakes I see organizations make with network automation is **starting too big**. They try to automate their entire infrastructure at once and get overwhelmed.

The most successful teams take a **"Crawl-Walk-Run"** approach:

### 🐢 Crawl Phase
- Automate configuration backups
- Deploy simple read-only checks and audits
- Build confidence with low-risk automation

### 🚶 Walk Phase
- Automate VLAN provisioning and access port changes
- Implement automated compliance reporting
- Start using automation for standard changes

### 🏃 Run Phase
- Full self-service network provisioning
- Automated incident remediation
- CI/CD pipelines for network changes

**I put together a brief guide** on how to get started with network automation using Ansible—no prior experience required.

Would it be helpful if I sent that over?

## 📧 Email 3: Social Proof / Case Study
**Subject Line Options:**
- "How {{SimilarCompany}} automated 500+ network devices"
- "From 4 hours to 4 minutes: A network automation story"
- "{{FirstName}}, thought you'd find this relevant"

Hi {{FirstName}},

I recently worked with a networking team that was in a situation similar to what many enterprises face today:

**The Challenge:**
- 500+ network devices across multiple data centers
- 3 different vendors (Cisco, Arista, Juniper)
- A 4-person team drowning in change requests
- Average time to implement a standard change: **4+ hours**

**The Solution:**
They implemented Ansible Automation Platform to standardize their network operations.

**The Results (within 90 days):**
- ⏱️ Standard changes now take **under 4 minutes**
- 🛡️ Configuration-related incidents dropped by **80%**
- 📋 Compliance audits went from weeks to hours
- 😊 Team morale improved—they're now focused on projects, not tickets

The best part? **No agents required.** Ansible connects over SSH or APIs, so there was zero disruption to their production environment.

I'd love to walk you through how they did it and discuss whether a similar approach could work for {{CompanyName}}.

**Do you have 20 minutes this week or next?**

## 📧 Email 4: Gentle Nudge
**Subject Line Options:**
- "Did this slip through the cracks, {{FirstName}}?"
- "Quick follow-up on network automation"
- "Last thing I'll send (unless you're interested)"

**Send Day:** Day 12

Hi {{FirstName}},

I know your inbox is probably overflowing, so I'll keep this brief.

I've reached out a couple of times about how Ansible Automation Platform can transform network operations at {{CompanyName}}.

I don't want to be a bother, so I'll leave you with this:

**If any of these sound familiar, automation can help:**
- [ ] "We spend too much time on repetitive network changes"
- [ ] "Troubleshooting takes forever because we can't trust our documentation"
- [ ] "Our network team is a bottleneck for application deployments"
- [ ] "Compliance audits are painful and time-consuming"

If even one of those resonates, I'd love 15 minutes to show you a better way.

**If not, no worries at all**—I'll stop reaching out.

Either way, I hope you have a great week!

Best,

## 📧 Email 5: Breakup Email
**Subject Line Options:**
- "Should I close your file, {{FirstName}}?"
- "Parting ways (for now)"
- "One last thing before I go"

**Send Day:** Day 18

Hi {{FirstName}},

I haven't heard back from you, and I want to respect your time.

I'll assume network automation isn't a priority right now, and that's completely okay—timing is everything.

Before I go, I wanted to leave you with a few resources in case things change down the road:

📚 **Resources:**
- [Ansible Network Automation Getting Started Guide]({{Link1}})
- [Network Automation ROI Calculator]({{Link2}})
- [On-Demand Webinar: Automating Multi-Vendor Networks]({{Link3}})

If things change or you'd like to revisit this conversation in the future, my door is always open.

Wishing you and the {{CompanyName}} team all the best!

Best,  
{{SenderName}}
