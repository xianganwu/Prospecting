### InMail 1: For Pawan Verma (CDIO)
**Subject:** Network automation to support Cencora's digital transformation

---

Hi Pawan,

Congratulations on your new role as CDIO at Cencora—it's an exciting time to lead technology transformation in pharmaceutical distribution.

I noticed Cencora is investing heavily in digital infrastructure, with a $1B commitment through 2030 and focus areas like AI-driven analytics and supply chain optimization.

One area I've seen Fortune 100 healthcare companies accelerate their transformation is **network automation**. Leading organizations are:

- Deploying consistent configurations across 50+ countries in minutes
- Generating compliance audit reports (FDA/HIPAA) automatically
- Reducing configuration-related incidents by 80%+

The Ansible Automation Platform is enabling this at scale—agentless, multi-vendor, and integrated with the AI/data platforms you're likely investing in.

Given your background driving digital innovation at MetLife and Foot Locker, I thought this might resonate.

**Would a 20-minute conversation be worthwhile to explore if this could support Cencora's infrastructure goals?**

Best,
{{SenderName}}

### InMail 2: For Ajay Gupta (CISO)
**Subject:** Automating network security configurations at scale

---

Hi Ajay,

Congratulations on being recognized as a Top Global CISO for 2024—well deserved given the complexity of securing a global pharmaceutical supply chain.

I work with CISOs at healthcare organizations on a challenge I imagine is familiar: **ensuring network security configurations are consistent and auditable across a global infrastructure.**

With Ansible Automation Platform, security teams are achieving:

- **Automated firewall rule deployment** across all sites
- **Continuous compliance validation** for HIPAA, FDA, and internal policies
- **Complete audit trails** for every network change
- **Reduced attack surface** through consistent, tested configurations

Given Cencora's 50+ country footprint and the criticality of your supply chain, I thought this might be relevant to your 2025 priorities.

Would a brief conversation make sense?

Best,
{{SenderName}}

### InMail 3: For VP/Director of Network Engineering
**Subject:** Scaling network operations across 50+ countries

---

Hi {{FirstName}},

I work with network leaders at global healthcare companies facing a common challenge: **managing thousands of network devices across multiple data centers, distribution hubs, and regions—often with a lean team.**

I wanted to share how similar organizations are using Ansible Automation Platform to:

- Push configuration changes to 1,000+ devices in under an hour
- Eliminate the "snowflake" configurations that cause outages
- Give teams back 20+ hours/week previously spent on manual tasks
- Generate compliance reports for auditors automatically

Given Cencora's scale (50+ countries, expanding distribution network) and mix of network vendors, I thought this might resonate.

**Would a quick call to explore this make sense?**

Best,

## 💬 LinkedIn Follow-Up Messages (After Connection)

### Follow-Up 1: Day 2 After Acceptance
```
Thanks for connecting, {{FirstName}}! I noticed Cencora is investing heavily in infrastructure expansion. If network automation ever becomes a priority—automating configs, compliance, or operations across your global footprint—I'd be happy to share how similar orgs have approached it. No pressure either way.
```

---

### Follow-Up 2: Day 5 (If No Response)
```
Hi {{FirstName}}—wanted to share a quick resource: a case study on how a Fortune 100 pharma distributor automated their network operations across 30+ countries. Happy to send it over if you're interested. Let me know!
```

---

### Follow-Up 3: Day 10 (Soft CTA)
```
Hi {{FirstName}}—one more thought and I'll stop bugging you. Given Cencora's $1B infrastructure investment through 2030, I imagine scaling operations efficiently is a priority. If there's ever interest in discussing how Ansible helps healthcare companies do that, I'm an open book. Wishing you and the team a great quarter!
```
